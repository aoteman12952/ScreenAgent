Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Search Baidu Baike for an introduction to computer science and technology\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Locate and open the Firefox Web browser.\n\n    2. In the address bar of the browser, type 'https://baike.baidu.com/' and press Enter.\n\n    3. Enter 'computer science and technology'into the Baidu Baike search bar.\n\n    4. Browse the results\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Browse the results\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Browse the results\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "Based on the provided screen image showing the Baidu Baike search results for \"computer science and technology,\" we can see a link that seems to provide an introduction to computer science and technology. The link is a text entry titled \"computer science and technology and Technology\" (\"计算机科学与技术\" in Chinese) underlined with blue.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't interact with images or webpages since I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and don't have the ability to actively interact with a real-world interface. However, I can guide you on what actions to take. To click on this link, you would need to move the mouse cursor over this link and then click the left mouse button.\n\nAssuming the text link is located approximately at the width center of the screen and slightly below the first third of the height, a suitable action would be (please adjust the exact width and height values according to the actual position of the link on your screen):\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":512,\"height\":300}}\n]\n```\n\nPlease note that the exact `mouse_position` values provided above are estimations based on the appearance of the interface. Actual values would depend on measuring the precise screen coordinates of the link you want to click on.",
