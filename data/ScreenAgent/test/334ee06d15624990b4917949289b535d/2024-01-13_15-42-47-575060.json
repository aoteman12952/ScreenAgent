Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Search Baidu Baike for an introduction to computer science and technology\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Locate and open the Firefox Web browser.\n\n    2. In the address bar of the browser, type 'https://baike.baidu.com/' and press Enter.\n\n    3.

The \"mouse_position\" values are approximate and would need to be adjusted to the precise position of the Firefox icon on the actual screen.",
