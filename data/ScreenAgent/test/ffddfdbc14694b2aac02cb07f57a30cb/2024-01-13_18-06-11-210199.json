Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Start the presentation from the third slide\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Select the third slide by clicking on it.\n\n    2. Start the presentation by clicking on the 'Slide Show' button on the toolbar\n\n    3. Choose 'start from current slide'.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Choose 'start from current slide'.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Choose 'start from current slide'.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "To complete the subtask \"Choose 'start from current slide'\" given the current screen state, we should click the \"Start from Current Slide\" which is an option under the \"Slide Show\" dropdown menu in the toolbar. This menu is present towards the top of the window, and the particular option is aligned with the toolbar button for starting the slideshow.\n\nAs it's not possible to provide the exact coordinates without an active screen measurement, I will make an educated guess based on typical positioning within the user interface of presentation software such as LibreOffice Impress, which is shown in the screenshot.\n\nThe estimated action sequence in JSON format would be:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":150,\"height\":50}}\n]\n```\n\nThis sequence indicates a single left mouse click around the dropdown region where \"Start from Current Slide\" is located. The coordinates width:150, height:50 are estimated and intended to indicate the relative position near the top toolbar, likely where the \"Slide Show\" dropdown menu is based on the screenshot provided. Please adjust the width and height values if necessary, based on the actual interface layout and pixel coordinates.",
