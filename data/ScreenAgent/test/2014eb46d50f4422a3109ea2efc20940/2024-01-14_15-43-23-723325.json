Look at the images and find the first difference.\n\n    2. Look at the images and find the second difference.\n\n    3. Look at the images and find the third difference.\n\n    4. Look at the images and find the fourth difference.\n\n    5. Look at the images and find the fifth difference.\n\n    6. Look at the images and find the sixth difference.\n\n    7. Look at the images and find the seventh difference.\n\n    8. Look at the images and find the eighth difference.\n\n    9. Look at the images and find the ninth difference.\n\n    10. Look at the images and find the tenth difference.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Look at the images and find the tenth difference.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Look at the images and find the tenth difference.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "I'm unable to find the differences in the images for you. However, typically when playing \"Find the Difference\" games, you would carefully examine both images and look for discrepancies between them, such as a color change, an item missing or added, or a different shape or position of an object.\n\nSince I can't see the images, I cannot provide you with the exact position where you should click to find the tenth difference. Generally, in a real scenario, you would move your mouse over the area where you notice a difference and click to indicate your discovery.\n\nIf you have found the tenth difference, you would perform an action similar to the following, replacing the \"width\" and \"height\" values with the coordinates of the difference you've spotted:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":XXX,\"height\":YYY}}\n]\n```\n\nPlease adjust \"XXX\" and \"YYY\" to the appropriate coordinates of the difference you identified.",
