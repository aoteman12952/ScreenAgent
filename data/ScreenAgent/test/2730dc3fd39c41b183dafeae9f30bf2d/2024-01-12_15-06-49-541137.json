Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Decrease text size\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Highlight the text 'Hello, world!'.\n\n    2. Click on the 'Font Size' dropdown in the toolbar.\n\n    3. Select a smaller font size from the dropdown list and apply it.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click on the 'Font Size' dropdown in the toolbar.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click on the 'Font Size' dropdown in the toolbar.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "Based on the image provided, which shows the LibreOffice Writer application, the 'Font Size' dropdown appears to be visible within the toolbar at the top of the screen. To click on the 'Font Size' dropdown, I will need to perform a mouse action that moves the cursor to the position of the 'Font Size' dropdown and then clicks it. Assuming a screen resolution of 1024x768 and judging by the standard layout of LibreOffice Writer, the 'Font Size' dropdown is likely somewhere near the upper center area of the screen.\n\nHere is a hypothetical action sequence in JSON format which accomplishes the current subtask:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":250,\"height\":60}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":250,\"height\":60}}\n]\n```\n\nThis sequence consists of moving the cursor to the general vicinity of where the 'Font Size' dropdown is expected to be (width 250, height 60 as a rough estimate) and clicking it. The specific mouse_position values may need to be adjusted to match the exact screen layout and position of the dropdown.",
