Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"View browser history\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Open web browser (e.g., double-click on 'Firefox W...' icon on the desktop).\n\n    2. Once browser is open, access the browser history using keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+H'\n\n    3. Click today for today's history\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Once browser is open, access the browser history using keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+H'\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Once browser is open, access the browser history using keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+H'\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "To access the browser history using the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+H' in Firefox, here is what the execution action would look like in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Control_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"H\"}\n]\n``` \n\nHowever, since these actions are meant to be performed sequentially, not simultaneously, we would ideally include a small delay between pressing 'Control_L' and 'H' to ensure that they are registered as a combination. Moreover, real-world applications might need a release action for the keys, but it's not specified in the available actions list, and there's no need for wait time between the keypresses as the system will register them in quick succession. Here's an improved version of the actions:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Control_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":0.05},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"H\"}\n]\n```\n\nNote: The provided list of optional actions does not include a 'release' action for keys, which is typically part of emulating keyboard input. In a real implementation, you would also want to release the 'Control_L' key after pressing 'H' to avoid potential issues with other inputs.",
