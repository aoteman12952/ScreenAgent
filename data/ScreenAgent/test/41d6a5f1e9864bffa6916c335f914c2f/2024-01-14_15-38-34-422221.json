Open web browser by double-clicking on the Firefox icon on the desktop.\n\n    2. In the browser's address bar, type 'www.bing.com' and press Enter to navigate to Bing search engine.\n\n    3. In the Bing search bar, type 'object detection TPAMI journal paper' and press Enter to start the search.\n\n    4. Browse through the search results to find a link to the TPAMI journal or a direct link to the paper.\n\n    5. Click on the link.\n\n    6. Once on the page, look for a download option for the paper.\n\n    7. Click on the download link or button to download the paper to your computer.\n\n    8. Check the download progress in the browser’s download manager and wait for the paper to be fully downloaded.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Check the download progress in the browser’s download manager and wait for the paper to be fully downloaded.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Check the download progress in the browser’s download manager and wait for the paper to be fully downloaded.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "To check the download progress in the browser's download manager, you would generally look for a download icon or open the download history. In the provided image, there is a clear indication in the Firefox browser that a PDF file (probably the one referred to in the instructions) is open, as seen by the \"1904.09146.pdf\" tab alongside other tabs. However, there is no direct indication of the download manager or download progress.\n\nSince the current goal is to check the download progress and the assumption is that the document is in the process of downloading, I will guide you through the actions to open the Firefox download manager. In Firefox, the download manager can be accessed by clicking the download icon, typically located in the upper right corner of the window. If the download icon is not immediately visible, it can be accessed by clicking the menu button (three horizontal lines) and then clicking the \"Downloads\" (an icon showing a downward arrow over a horizontal line) option.\n\nBased on the image, it seems the download icon is potentially not visible, so here is a sequence of actions to open the download manager through the menu:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":1000,\"height\":50}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":960,\"height\":160}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction",
