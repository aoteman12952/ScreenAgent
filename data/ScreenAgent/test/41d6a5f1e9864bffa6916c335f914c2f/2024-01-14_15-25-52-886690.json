Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Download a paper on object detection from the TPAMI journal using Bing search engine\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Open web browser by double-clicking on the Firefox icon on the desktop.\n\n    2. In the browser's address bar, type 'www.bing.com' and press Enter to navigate to Bing search engine.\n\n    3. In the Bing search bar, type 'object detection TPAMI journal paper' and press Enter to start the search.\n\n    4. Browse through the search results to find a link to the TPAMI journal or a direct link to the paper.\n\n    5. Click on the link.\n\n    6. Once on the page, look for a download option for the paper.\n\n    7. Click on the download link or button to download the paper to your computer.\n\n    8. Check the download progress in the browserâ€™s download manager and wait for the paper to be fully downloaded.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Browse through the search results to find a link to the TPAMI journal or a direct link to the paper.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Browse through the search results to find a link to the TPAMI journal or a direct link to the paper.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "Based on the screen image provided and the subtask at hand, the next actions would be to click on one of the links that appear to lead to the TPAMI (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence) journal or directly to the paper. For example, the first link in the search results seems to be from IEEE Xplore, which is likely to have the paper.\n\nWe will execute a left mouse click on the first link under the search results. Typically, search result links are positioned near the top of the browser window, but below the address and search bars. Assuming a 1024x768 resolution and the layout of the elements in the screenshot, the link would hypothetically be positioned around a width of 150 pixels (centered horizontally in the left half of the screen) and a height of around 250 pixels (vertical position depending on the browser's display of the page). Please note that the actual coordinates might vary based on the displayed elements and scaling.\n\nHere is the action in JSON format:\n\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":150,\"height\":250}}\n]\n```",
