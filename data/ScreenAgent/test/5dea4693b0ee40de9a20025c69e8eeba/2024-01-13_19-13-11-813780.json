Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Watch SpongeBob on Bilibili in an opened browser and drag the progress bar to the middle\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Type 'www.bilibili.com' into the address bar.\n\n    2. Press Enter to navigate to Bilibili.\n\n    3. Use the Bilibili search bar to type 'SpongeBob'.\n\n    4. Press enter to view search results\n\n    5. Select a SpongeBob episode from the search results.\n\n    6. Move the mouse to in the middle of the video.\n\n    7. Click the progress bar to the middle of the video.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click the progress bar to the middle of the video.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click the progress bar to the middle of the video.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "To click the progress bar to the middle of the video, I need to estimate the position of the progress bar and calculate the position that would represent its middle. Based on the resolution of the screen (1024x768), the progress bar's mid-point seems to be around half of the video width, which is 512 pixels from the left. The height seems to be close to the bottom of the video player, which we can estimate a bit above the play controls (likely around the height of 720 pixels).\n\nUsing this estimated position, here is the JSON action to click the middle of the progress bar:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":512,\"height\":720}}\n]\n```\n\nThese coordinates are a rough estimation based on visual assessment of the position of the progress bar within the player's layout.",
