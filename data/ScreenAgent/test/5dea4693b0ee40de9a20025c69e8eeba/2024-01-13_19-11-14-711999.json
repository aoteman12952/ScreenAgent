Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Watch SpongeBob on Bilibili in an opened browser and drag the progress bar to the middle\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Type 'www.bilibili.com' into the address bar.\n\n    2. Press Enter to navigate to Bilibili.\n\n    3. Use the Bilibili search bar to type 'SpongeBob'.\n\n    4. Press enter to view search results\n\n    5. Select a SpongeBob episode from the search results.\n\n    6. Move the mouse to in the middle of the video.\n\n    7. Click the progress bar to the middle of the video.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Move the mouse to in the middle of the video.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Move the mouse to in the middle of the video.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "Based on the screen resolution provided and the image shown, I'll estimate the mouse position to move the cursor to the middle of the video. The width of the video is not explicitly provided, but assuming it spans most of the screen width (1024 pixels), the middle would be approximately at half this width.\n\nThe height of the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks bar, and potential other elements like the Windows taskbar need to be considered. The height is estimated to be around 100 pixels. Thus, the middle of the height of the screen minus the top chrome of the browser could be estimated to be around half the remaining pixels. If the video player is centered vertically in the browser window, that could be approximately at 768 / 2 + 100 pixels (considering some space for the browser UI at the top).\n\nHere's the estimated action in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":512,\"height\":484}}\n]\n``` \n\nPlease note that this estimation might not be perfectly accurate due to the potential presence of different UI elements such as tabs and toolbars which can vary in size. The heights of these elements would need to be measured or precisely known to make an exact calculation.",
