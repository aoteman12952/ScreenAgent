Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Open Calculator and calculate the result of 50 minus 8\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Click the Start menu\n\n    2. Type 'Calculator' in the search bar\n\n    3. Select 'Calculator' from the search results\n\n    4. Type '50'\n\n    5. Click the 'minus' button or type '-'\n\n    6. Type '8'\n\n    7. Click 'equals' button to calculate the result\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Type 'Calculator' in the search bar\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Type 'Calculator' in the search bar\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

Here are the actions to type 'Calculator' into the search bar:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Calculator\"}\n]\n``` \n\nThese actions simulate typing \"Calculator\" directly, which assumes that the search bar is already active. If the search bar is not active, you may need to add another action to click on the search bar before typing. However, since it seems the Start menu is in focus, typing should immediately input text into the search bar.",
