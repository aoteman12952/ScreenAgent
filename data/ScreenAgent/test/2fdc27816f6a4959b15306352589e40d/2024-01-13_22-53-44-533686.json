Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Select and add a smartphone to the shopping cart using the search bar on a shopping page\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Click on the search bar to activate the text field for typing.\n\n    2. Type the keyword 'smartphone' into the search bar.\n\n    3. Press the 'Enter' key or click on the search icon next to the search bar to initiate the search.\n\n    4. Select a smartphone by clicking on its image or link to view its details.\n\n    5. On the smartphone's detail page, locate and click the 'Add to Cart' button.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"On the smartphone's detail page, locate and click the 'Add to Cart' button.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"On the smartphone's detail page, locate and click the 'Add to Cart' button.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "Based on the provided screenshot, it appears that the 'Add to Cart' button (which, judging by common web design patterns and the apparent use of the color orange which often signifies a call to action, I assume to be the orange button) is visible on the screen. Assuming the 'Add to Cart' button is at a certain position on the screen, we can create a mouse action to perform a left-click on that location.\n\nConsidering the resolution of 1024x768, I estimate the button to be approximately at the horizontal center of the screen and somewhat below the middle of the vertical axis. I'll provide a JSON action assuming the button is around the center but slightly to the right (which is common for a right-aligned layout), and placing the button vertically at about two-thirds of the screen height.\n\nHere is the approximate action:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":512,\"height\":500}}\n]\n```\nBear in mind that the precise coordinates for the 'Add to Cart' button must be determined from the actual screen, as estimating from a static image does not guarantee accuracy.",
