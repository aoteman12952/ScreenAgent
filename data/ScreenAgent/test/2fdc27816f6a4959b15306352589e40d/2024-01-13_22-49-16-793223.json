Click on the search bar to activate the text field for typing.\n\n    2. Type the keyword 'smartphone' into the search bar.\n\n    3. Press the 'Enter' key or click on the search icon next to the search bar to initiate the search.\n\n    4. Select a smartphone by clicking on its image or link to view its details.\n\n    5. On the smartphone's detail page, locate and click the 'Add to Cart' button.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Press the 'Enter' key or click on the search icon next to the search bar to initiate the search.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Press the 'Enter' key or click on the search icon next to the search bar to initiate the search.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "Based on the provided image of the computer screen with a web browser opened to a shopping site, and considering the keyword 'smartphone' is already typed in the search bar, the next action to initiate the search would be to click on the search icon (magnifying glass) next to the search bar.\n\nSince the exact position of the search icon is not supplied directly, I will make an educated guess based on common web design practices. Usually, the search icon is placed at the far right end of the search bar. The screen resolution is 1024x768, and considering the search bar is towards the top of the browser window, here's a JSON action that would generally represent clicking on the search icon:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":950,\"height\":50}}\n]\n```\n\nPlease note that the mouse position for the click action is a rough estimate and would ideally need to be adjusted to the exact coordinates of the search icon on the page.",
