Assuming an approximate position for the search bar, the actions could be as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":500,\"height\":150}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\":\"latest developments in autonomous driving\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON array first performs a left-click action to focus on the search bar, then uses a keyboard action to type the search term, and finally presses the Return (Enter) key to start the search. Please note that the mouse position values are approximate and should be adjusted according to the actual position of the search bar on your screen.",
