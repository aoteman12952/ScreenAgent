Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Increase the volume of an opened web video\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Move the mouse to the lower part of the video screen.\n\n    2. Move to the volume icon.\n\n    3. Mouse click to select louder volume\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Move the mouse to the lower part of the video screen.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Move the mouse to the lower part of the video screen.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "To move the mouse to the lower part of the video screen where the video controls typically are, including the volume icon, we must make an educated estimation of the position since the video controls are not visible in this provided image. These controls typically appear when the mouse hovers over the lower part of the video area. Given that the video has a width of 1024 pixels, the controls are likely to be centered. And given that the video has a height of 768 pixels, the controls will be near the bottom of the video, but not at the very bottom to avoid interacting with the browser's own interface or taskbar.\n\nConsidering that and aiming to be slightly above the very bottom to ensure we are within the video frame, an example action might be as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":512,\"height\":720}}\n]\n```\n\nThis action moves the mouse to the horizontal center of the screen (width: 512, which is half of 1024), and slightly above the bottom of the video (height: 720, assuming the video controls might activate a few pixels above the bottom edge). The exact height may need adjusting based on where the video controls actually appear.",
