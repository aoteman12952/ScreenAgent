Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Find and add the cheapest chocolate to the cart on Amazon\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Search for 'chocolate' in the search box.\n\n    2. Click the filter button.\n\n    3. Sort the search results by price from low to high by selecting the 'Sort' dropdown or filter option.\n\n    4. Identify the cheapest chocolate item from the list of sorted search results.\n\n    5. Click on the 'Add to Cart' button to add the cheapest chocolate to the cart.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click on the 'Add to Cart' button to add the cheapest chocolate to the cart.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click on the 'Add to Cart' button to add the cheapest chocolate to the cart.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "Based on the current screen image, the 'Add to Cart' button for the selected chocolate item seems to be in view. To click this button, we need to direct a mouse action to its location on the screen. \n\nJudging from the image provided, the 'Add to Cart' button appears to be about 3/4 of the way down the screen on the horizontal axis and about halfway across the screen on the vertical axis. Therefore, an approximate position on a 1024x768 screen could be around width: 512 and height: 576. However, because exact button positioning can vary, some trial and error may be necessary to find the exact coordinates. Here's the JSON action assuming the 'Add to Cart' button is at the estimated position:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":512,\"height\":576}}\n]\n```\n\nIf the button is not at that precise location, a 'MouseAction' of type 'move' may be necessary to locate the cursor over the 'Add to Cart' button before clicking. Please note that the exact position could be different based on actual UI elements layout, screen resolution, and browser zoom level.",
