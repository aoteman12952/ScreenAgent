Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Change paper size to B4\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Click on the 'Layout' tab in Microsoft Word.\n\n    2. In the 'Page Setup' group, click on the 'Size' button.\n\n    3. Click on the 'B4 (JIS)' option to change the paper size to B4.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"In the 'Page Setup' group, click on the 'Size' button.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"In the 'Page Setup' group, click on the 'Size' button.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "Based on the current screen image of the Microsoft Word application, it appears that the 'Layout' tab is already selected, which properly sets our context for interacting with the 'Page Setup' group. The 'Size' button should be located in this group. Given the standard layout of the Word ribbon, the 'Size' button is typically near the left side of the 'Page Setup' group.\n\nHowever, since I can't visually identify the exact position of the 'Size' button on your screen due to interface language differences or potential customization, I'll provide a general estimate. In a typical Word setup on a 1024x768 resolution screen, the 'Size' button could be approximately 1/4th of the way from the left side of the ribbon.\n\nLet's estimate a mouse action that moves the cursor to a position that is 1/4th across the width of the screen and roughly in the vertical middle of the ribbon:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"action_type\": \"MouseAction\",\n        \"mouse_action_type\": \"click\",\n        \"mouse_button\": \"left\",\n        \"mouse_position\": {\n            \"width\": 256, // 1/4th across the width of the screen (1024 / 4)\n            \"height\": 60   // Estimated vertical position of the 'Size' button on the ribbon\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\nYou may need to adjust the `width` and `height` parameters according to the actual",
