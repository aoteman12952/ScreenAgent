Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Partition 2GB from C drive to create D drive\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Right-click on the C: drive in Disk Management.\n\n    2. Select 'Shrink Volume...' from the context menu.\n\n    3. In the Shrink dialog, enter the amount of space to shrink in MB (2048 for 2GB).\n\n    4. Click on 'Shrink' to create unallocated space.\n\n    5. Right-click on the new unallocated space.\n\n    6. Select 'New Simple Volume...' from the context menu.\n\n    7. Follow the New Simple Volume Wizard to assign the drive letter D and format the new partition.\n\n    8. Complete the wizard and wait for the format to finish.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Select 'New Simple Volume...' from the context menu.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Select 'New Simple Volume...' from the context menu.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

Assuming that the context menu is properly aligned with the unallocated space entry in the Disk Management window and is visible on the screen with the \"New Simple Volume...\" option at a guessable position, the following JSON action plan should achieve this:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":700,\"height\":400}}\n]\n```\n\nThis action assumes that the context menu position will allow the \"New Simple Volume...\" option to be around 700 pixels from the left and 400 pixels from the top of the screen based on the image provided. Please note that without precise coordinates, this is an educated estimate. If the menu were actually displayed, on a real screen, the exact coordinates could be determined by hovering over the \"New Simple Volume...\" option.",
