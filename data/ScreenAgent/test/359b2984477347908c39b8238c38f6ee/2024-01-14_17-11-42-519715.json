Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Partition 2GB from C drive to create D drive\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Right-click on the C: drive in Disk Management.\n\n    2. Select 'Shrink Volume...' from the context menu.\n\n    3. In the Shrink dialog, enter the amount of space to shrink in MB (2048 for 2GB).\n\n    4. Click on 'Shrink' to create unallocated space.\n\n    5. Right-click on the new unallocated space.\n\n    6. Select 'New Simple Volume...' from the context menu.\n\n    7. Follow the New Simple Volume Wizard to assign the drive letter D and format the new partition.\n\n    8. Complete the wizard and wait for the format to finish.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Select 'Shrink Volume...' from the context menu.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Select 'Shrink Volume...' from the context menu.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

The context menu with this option is already open on the screen, positioned over the C: drive section of the Disk Management window.\n\nGiven that the resolution is 1024x768 and assuming the context menu's position is around the center of the C: drive bar in the Disk Management window, I will estimate a mouse position that might be over the \"Shrink Volume...\" option in the context menu. Please note that these coordinates are an estimate as the exact position cannot be determined from the image provided:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":300,\"height\":400}}\n]\n```\n\nThis action represents a single left-click of the mouse approximately at the location where \"Shrink Volume...\" would be expected in the context menu. If the coordinates are slightly off, you may need to adjust the \"width\" and \"height\" values to correctly position the mouse over the \"Shrink Volume...\" option.",
