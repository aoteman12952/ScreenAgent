However, since I can't provide specific coordinates and there is no visible 'Sort by' dropdown in the provided image, I would suggest a general action that typically would move the cursor to the area where a 'Sort by' dropdown is usually located on a shopping site like Amazon. This area is commonly found near the top of the list of products or at the top of the page. \n\nPlease note, since I canâ€™t see the exact 'Sort by' dropdown on the current screen image, the action below is based on a typical placement within the Amazon website layout:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":920,\"height\":175}}\n]\n```\n\nYou would need to look at the screen to place the mouse at the correct location of the 'Sort by' dropdown filter. Once you've manually located it, you can replace the `width` and `height` values with the accurate coordinates for the dropdown on your screen. After clicking on the dropdown, you would proceed by selecting the 'Customer Reviews' filter from the options that appear.",
