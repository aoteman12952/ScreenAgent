Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Find \"world\" in the document and replace with \"everyone\"\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Click on 'Edit' in the menu bar.\n\n    2. Select 'Find and Replace' from the dropdown menu.\n\n    3. In the 'Find and Replace' dialog box, type \"world\" in the 'Find' field.\n\n    4. Type \"everyone\" in the 'Replace with' field.\n\n    5. Click 'Replace All' to replace every instance of \"world\" with \"everyone\".\n\n    6. Close the 'Find & Replace' dialog box.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click on 'Edit' in the menu bar.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click on 'Edit' in the menu bar.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "The image provided is of LibreOffice Writer, which is an open-source word processing program that is part of the LibreOffice suite, and it is different from any of the Microsoft Windows' built-in applications. However, most word processors, including LibreOffice Writer, follow a similar graphical user interface layout. \n\nConsidering the goal described, we need to click 'Edit' in the menu bar of LibreOffice Writer to access the 'Find and Replace' functionality. The 'Edit' menu is typically located at the top of the screen in the menu bar, second from the left, following 'File'. Based on standard layouts and assuming that the image reflects the standard behavior at a resolution of 1024x768, the 'Edit' menu should be in the upper left area of the screen.\n\nGiven that mouse actions are relative to the top-left corner of the screen, we can estimate the position to click 'Edit' as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":60,\"height\":10}}\n]\n```\n\nThis action would simulate the user clicking on the 'Edit' menu item in LibreOffice Writer.",
