Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Use terminal commands to delete a folder on the desktop\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Navigate to the desktop directory using the command 'cd Desktop/'.\n\n    2. List the items on the desktop with the command 'ls' to view the folder you want to delete.\n\n    3. Use the command 'rm -r FOLDERNAME' to delete the folder, replacing 'FOLDERNAME' with the actual name of the folder.\n\n    4. Verify deletion by using the 'ls' command again to ensure the folder is deleted.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Use the command 'rm -r FOLDERNAME' to delete the folder, replacing 'FOLDERNAME' with the actual name of the folder.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Use the command 'rm -r FOLDERNAME' to delete the folder, replacing 'FOLDERNAME' with the actual name of the folder.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "The image provided appears to show a Linux desktop environment rather than Windows, as evidenced by the application names ending with `.desktop`, which are typical of Linux systems, and the general appearance of the GUI elements. In Linux, the command `rm -r FOLDERNAME` would indeed be used to delete a folder.\n\nIf the goal is to delete a folder named \"Discarded\" that we can see on the desktop, here's how to proceed via the terminal shown in the image:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"rm -r Discarded\\n\"}\n]\n```\n\nThis command sequence sends the text to delete the \"Discarded\" folder, followed by a newline character (`\\n`) to execute the command. This will recursively remove the folder named \"Discarded\" and all of its contents.\n\nIf this were a Windows environment, and you wanted to use terminal commands to delete a folder, you would typically use Command Prompt or PowerShell, and the command would differ. For example, in PowerShell, you would use `Remove-Item 'FOLDERNAME' -Recurse` to delete a folder with its contents. But as we're working with a Linux system according to the image, we stick with the `rm -r` command as specified.",
