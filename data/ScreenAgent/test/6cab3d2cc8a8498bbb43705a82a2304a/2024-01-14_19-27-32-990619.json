Assuming the search box is at approximately one fifth of the screen width from the left, and one tenth of the screen height from the top, based on typical webpage layouts, here is how the actions might be structured in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":205,\"height\":76}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\":\"Sanya\"}\n]\n```\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario, the width and height in the mouse_position field may need to be adjusted according to the actual position of the search box on the Booking.com website. The values provided are only educated guesses based on a typical webpage layout and screen resolution.
