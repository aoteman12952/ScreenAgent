The next actions would be to click into the search or address bar and type \"Booking.com\". Given the image, the search bar is at the top-center of the browser interface. The approximate position looks to be around a quarter of the screen width from the left and relatively close to the top of the screen, but the exact coordinates can't be determined from the image, so I'll estimate the position for clicking the search bar:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":256,\"height\":50}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\":\"booking.com\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\nThe first action simulates a mouse click to focus on the address bar, the second action is to type the website address, and the last action is to press the Enter key to navigate to the website.
