Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Find the course with the highest attendance rate for student2 in the education_data table\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Check all records for student2.\n\n    2. Click on the sorting function.\n\n    3. Selection of sort key and descending order\n\n    4. Apply the sort and view the sort results to find the class with the highest attendance for student2.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Selection of sort key and descending order\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Selection of sort key and descending order\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

Move the mouse to the drop-down menu displaying \"Column A\" to select the correct column as the sort key. Assuming the attendance rate is in Column C (as per the screenshot), select this column.\n   \n2. Next, choose \"Descending\" to sort from the highest attendance rate to the lowest.\n\nOnce these selections are made, we will then be ready to apply the sort. Here are the mouse actions needed for these steps, provided in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":300,\"height\":375}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":300,\"height\":400}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":270,\"height\":420}}\n]\n```\n\nThese actions involve moving the mouse to the \"Column A\" drop-down menu, clicking to open it, moving to select Column C (which is usually immediately below or near the menu depending on the UI), and then moving and clicking the radio button for \"Descending\" order. The exact mouse positions (`width` and `height`) must be adjusted based on where these elements are positioned in the actual application window on your specific screen resolution setup",
