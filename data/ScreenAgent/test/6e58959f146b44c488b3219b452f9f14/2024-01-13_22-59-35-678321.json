Assuming a common e-commerce interface, such as the one provided by Amazon, here is a potential JSON plan to remove a smartphone from the shopping cart:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\": \"PlanAction\", \"element\": \"Navigate to the shopping cart icon on the webpage.\"},\n    {\"action_type\": \"PlanAction\", \"element\": \"Click on the shopping cart icon to view the cart.\"},\n    {\"action_type\": \"PlanAction\", \"element\": \"Identify the smartphone item in the list of products in the cart.\"},\n    {\"action_type\": \"PlanAction\", \"element\": \"Find the remove or delete option next to the smartphone item.\"},\n    {\"action_type\": \"PlanAction\", \"element\": \"Click on the remove or delete option to remove the smartphone from the cart.\"},\n    {\"action_type\": \"PlanAction\", \"element\": \"Verify that the smartphone has been successfully removed from the shopping cart.\"}\n]\n```\n\nThis is a generic plan that might need to be adjusted depending on the actual user interface and particular website features.
