Let's assume we're placing the formula in cell E31, which appears to be the first empty cell in column E based on the image.\n\nNext, we will type the SUMIF formula, which is `=SUMIF(range; criteria; sum_range)`. The `range` is where the 'South' criteria will be checked (column C), the `criteria` is `\"South\"`, and the `sum_range` is where the values to be summed are located (column E).\n\nGiven the layout seen in the image, let's proceed with the actions.\nHere's the JSON formatted output execution action plan:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":400,\"height\":725}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"=SUMIF(C2:C30, \\\"South\\\", E2:E30)\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\nThis action plan involves clicking into cell E31 and entering the SUMIF formula, which calculates the total profit for the 'South' region from",
