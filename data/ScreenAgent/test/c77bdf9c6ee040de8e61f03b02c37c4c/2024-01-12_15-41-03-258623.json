Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Align document content to the left\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Select the text you want to align to the left.\n\n    2. Click on the 'Align Left' icon in the toolbar.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click on the 'Align Left' icon in the toolbar.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click on the 'Align Left' icon in the toolbar.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "Based on the screen image provided, it appears the user is working in LibreOffice Writer, which is similar to Microsoft Word in functionality. To align the text to the left, one would normally click the \"Align Left\" icon located in the formatting toolbar at the top of the application window. The icon typically resembles lines of text aligned to the left side.\n\nIn the screenshot, the \"Align Left\" icon is the fourth item from the left in the top toolbar, just to the right of the \"Styles and Formatting\" (the icon with 'A' on it). Since the resolution of the screen is 1024x768, and the toolbar is near the top of the screen, the mouse position on the y-axis will be relatively low, while the position on the x-axis will be somewhere towards the left side but not at the very edge.\n\nGiven that this is a hypothetical scenario and the exact coordinates cannot be precisely determined from the image, the following action is an estimation:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":50,\"height\":50}}\n]\n```\nThis action simulates a left-click mouse event approximately where the \"Align Left\" icon is likely to be located on the toolbar. The coordinates may need to be adjusted according to the actual position of the icon within the application window.",
