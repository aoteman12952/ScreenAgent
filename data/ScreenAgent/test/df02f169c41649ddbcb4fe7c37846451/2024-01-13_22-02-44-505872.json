Move the mouse to the lower part of the video screen\n\n    2. Selecting Playback Speed Adjustment\n\n    3. Select 1.5x\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Selecting Playback Speed Adjustment\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Selecting Playback Speed Adjustment\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "To select the playback speed adjustment for this web video, the actions required would typically be to move the mouse to the settings control on the video player interface, which is where you can usually alter the speed of the video. The settings control is commonly represented by a gear icon on many video players.\n\nGiven the provided screenshot and the website in use, the gear icon for playback speed adjustment is located within the video player's overlay controls, which can be found at the lower right corner of the video screen. Therefore, we must first move the cursor to this area and then execute a click on the gear icon.\n\nHere is the JSON representation to move the mouse to the gear icon which seems to be approximately at the three-quarters width of the screen and very close to the bottom of the video area, and then click:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":768,\"height\":720}},\n  {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":768,\"height\":720}}\n]\n```\nPlease note that the coordinates provided (`{\"width\":768,\"height\":720}`) are based on a visual estimation using the provided screenshot.
