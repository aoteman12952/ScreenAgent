Click 'Add to Cart' to place the item in your shopping cart.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"On the item's product page, select the appropriate size for the child.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"On the item's product page, select the appropriate size for the child.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",
