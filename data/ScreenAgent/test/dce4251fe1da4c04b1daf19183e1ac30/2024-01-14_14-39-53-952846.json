Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Search for children's clothes on Amazon and select the appropriate size and color to add to the cart\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Locate the Amazon search bar.\n\n    2. Enter 'children's clothes' into the search bar.\n\n    3. Hit the Enter key to initiate the search.\n\n    4. Browse through the search results and select an item of children's clothing that you like.\n\n    5. On the item's product page, select the appropriate size for the child.\n\n    6. Click 'Add to Cart' to place the item in your shopping cart.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click 'Add to Cart' to place the item in your shopping cart.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click 'Add to Cart' to place the item in your shopping cart.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

The button has a distinctive yellow color which makes it stand out. To complete the subtask, the mouse cursor needs to be moved over the \"Add to Cart\" button and a left-click action should be initiated.\n\nHere's the JSON action plan to fulfill the subtask:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":750,\"height\":600}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":750,\"height\":600}}\n]\n```\n\nThis plan assumes the \"Add to Cart\" button is around the coordinates (750, 600).
