Now you need to use the Windows operating system to complete a mission.\nYour goal now is to manipulate a computer screen, video width: 1024, video height: 768, the overall mission is: \"Calculate average cost for 'clothing' product type in the financial_data table\".\n\nWe have developed an implementation plan for this overall mission:\n\n    1. Enter the averageif formula.\n\n    2. Press Enter to see the results of the formula.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Enter the averageif formula.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Enter the averageif formula.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",

    "LLM_response": "To enter the `AVERAGEIF` formula in the application shown (LibreOffice Calc), we need to click on the cell where we want the result to appear. From the image, it seems we want to put the formula in cell H2. Then, we need to enter the formula. The `AVERAGEIF` function is similar in syntax across different spreadsheet applications, where the first argument is the range to apply the criteria to, the second is the criteria itself (in this case \"Clothing\"), and the third is the range to calculate the average from.\n\nGiven the cursor seems to be already on cell H2 (based on the highlighted row number 2 and column letter H), the mouse click step can be minimized since the cell is already selected, so we would directly move on to entering the formula which would look something like this: `=AVERAGEIF(B:B, \"Clothing\", E:E)`.\n\nHere are the steps in JSON format:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\":\"=AVERAGEIF(B:B, \\\"Clothing\\\", E:E)\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\nThis action chain will input the formula into cell H2 and then execute it by pressing the Enter key, giving us the result of the average cost for 'clothing'.",
