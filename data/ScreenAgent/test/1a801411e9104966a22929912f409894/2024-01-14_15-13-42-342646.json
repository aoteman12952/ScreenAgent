Double-click on the Firefox icon to open the browser.\n\n    2. Type 'images of oranges' into the search bar and press Enter.\n\n    3. Click on images and browse through the image search results.\n\n    4. Click on an image of an orange that you want to download.\n\n    5. Right-click on the full-size image.\n\n    6. Select 'Save Image As...' from the context menu.\n\n    7. Navigate to the Desktop in the 'Save As' dialog box.\n\n    8. Type 'orange' as the file name.\n\n    9. Click the 'Save' button to download the image to the desktop.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click the 'Save' button to download the image to the desktop.\".\nYou can use the mouse and keyboard, the optional actions are:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"double_click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_up\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"scroll_down\",\"scroll_repeat\":int},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"move\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"drag\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":int,\"height\":int}},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"KeyName in keysymdef\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Ctrl+A\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"text\",\"keyboard_text\": \"Hello, world!\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"WaitAction\",\"wait_time\":float}\n]\n```\nWhere the mouse position is relative to the top-left corner of the screen, and the keyboard keys are described in [keysymdef.h].\n\nPlease make output execution actions, please format them in json, e.g. \nMy plan is to click the Windows button, it's on the left bottom corner, so my action will be:\n```json \n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"MouseAction\",\"mouse_action_type\":\"click\",\"mouse_button\":\"left\",\"mouse_position\":{\"width\":10,\"height\":760}}\n]\n```\n\nAnother example: \nMy plan is to open the notepad, so my action will be:\n```json\n[\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Super_L\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_text\":\"notepad\"},\n    {\"action_type\":\"KeyboardAction\",\"keyboard_action_type\":\"press\",\"keyboard_key\":\"Return\"}\n]\n```\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Click the 'Save' button to download the image to the desktop.\", please give the detailed next actions based on the state of the existing screen image.",
