Focus on the terminal window.\n\n    2. Use the package manager to install cmatrix. For example, if it's a Debian-based system, you would type 'sudo apt-get install cmatrix' and press Enter.\n\n    3. Wait for the installation to complete.\n\n    4. After installation, type 'cmatrix' and press Enter to run cmatrix.\n\n\nThe current subtask is \"Use the package manager to install cmatrix.
